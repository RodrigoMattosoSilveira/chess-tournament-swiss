/**
 * Define the Tournament requests API
 *
 * Here, we are importing the CommonRoutesConfig class and extending it to our new class, called TournamentRoutes. With
 * the constructor, we send the app (the main express.Application object) and the name UserRoutes to
 * CommonRoutesConfigâ€™s constructor.
 *
 * This example is quite simple, but when scaling to create several route files, this will help us avoid duplicate code.
 *
 * Suppose we would want to add new features in this file, such as logging. We could add the necessary field to the
 * CommonRoutesConfig class, and then all the routes that extend CommonRoutesConfig will have access to it.
