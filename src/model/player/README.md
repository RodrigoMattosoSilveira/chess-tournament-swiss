Model a tournament player

# Setup
## Model
A tournament player consists of a tournament, an user, and some attributes:
````typescript
export interface PlayerDto {
	id: string;						// generated by the server
	user: string;					// required, must exist
	tournament: string;				// required, must exist
	hadByeOrForfeit?: boolean;		// True after player had a bye or was awarded a forfeit
	byeNextRound?: boolean;			// True if player is scheduled for next round bye
	playedAgainst?: Array<number>; 	// Players (not users)
	playedColor?: Array<number>; 	// -1=Black, 1=White
	results?: Array<number>; 		// -1 = loss, 0.5=tie, 1=win
	state?:string; 		            // scheduled, withdrew, playing, forfeit, done
}

````

Note that the only attributes required to create a tournament player are the `user id` and `tournament id`. All other values are set to their defaults.
* id - Is generated when creating a tournament player;
* user - the generated user id;
* tournament - the generated tournament id;
* hadByeOrForfeit - default is `false`;
* byeNextRound - default is `false`;
* playedAgainst - default is `[]`;
* playedColor - default is `[]`;
* results - default is `[]`;
* state - default is `scheduled`;

## Creating users and tournaments

````bash
$ yarn start:dev
````
### Users
